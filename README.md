About the project:
As a part of our Software Engineering Lab course project, we are building ‘ExamTime’, a
multiple user-type system with the Django Rest Framework and React. We'll be building an
online school system where teachers can create assignments that students can complete and
view their results, thereby promoting peer-to-peer learning and boosting productivity.
