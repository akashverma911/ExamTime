About the project:
As a part of our Software Engineering Lab course project, we are building ‘ExamTime’, a
multiple user-type system with the Django Rest Framework and React. We'll be building an
online school system where teachers can create assignments that students can complete and
view their results, thereby promoting peer-to-peer learning and boosting productivity.


Description of the problem:
The current situation of pandemic has resulted in schools shut all across the world.
Nearly 1 billion children are deprived of the classroom. The education system of the country has
changed a lot in the past 2 years, thereby growing a new culture of e-learning, where teaching is
remote and digital. Exams play an important role in our education system and a necessary step
in giving students the correct marks. Scraping exams in higher education is not an option.
Online tests keep the momentum of the child learning and ensure his/her learning doesn't stop.
