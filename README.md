About the project:
As a part of our Software Engineering Lab course project, we are building ‘ExamTime’, a
multiple user-type system with the Django Rest Framework and React. We'll be building an
online school system where teachers can create assignments that students can complete and
view their results, thereby promoting peer-to-peer learning and boosting productivity.


Description of the problem:
The current situation of pandemic has resulted in schools shut all across the world.
Nearly 1 billion children are deprived of the classroom. The education system of the country has
changed a lot in the past 2 years, thereby growing a new culture of e-learning, where teaching is
remote and digital. Exams play an important role in our education system and a necessary step
in giving students the correct marks. Scraping exams in higher education is not an option.
Online tests keep the momentum of the child learning and ensure his/her learning doesn't stop.

Advantage of school system:
When teachers interact with students in classes, not all students try to answer the question,
making it difficult for teachers to assume whether students have understood the topic or not.
Therefore, ‘ExamTime’ is a free application to involve all students in the learning and feedback
process. The assessment will be posted by the teacher on our application where they can judge
students based on the assessment. Teachers can maintain students' performance based on the
result of their assessment. The result will be recorded and saved so that teachers can work on
student’s weaknesses and improve them.

What will our system do?
Our application will allow teachers to create test sheets for quizzes in a few minutes. Students
can then fill out those forms and view their results in their profiles. Based on the results teachers
can maintain students' reports and guide them. It will be a free online tool for conducting online
examinations easily and effectively providing separate systems for teacher and student

Justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitious
Considering the month of December as our deadline, we have 3 months to finish our
software and implement all the promised features. Since the team size is relatively small
and the project deadline is very close considering the size of the project, we have
decided to follow the "SCRUM Software Development Lifecycle Model", which puts
greater emphasis on quickly changing requirements of the clients(schools). The Scrum
model focuses on short, sharp delivery of projects after every (sprint) providing sufficient
time for feedback from the client and thereby easily making changes in the next sprint
hence saving a lot of time and resources for debugging and general overhead.
The proposal is neither too easy as we have promised to implement a multitude of
features, whereas not neglecting any security issues and any kind of loopholes in
classroom structure to reduce plagiarism as much as possible. Thus, we must devote a
significant amount of time to testing and error handling in general. The SCRUM Model
encourages frequent sprints, hence evolving code and making the project undergo
rigorous testing in each sprint thereby making the code more and more optimized and
less prone to bugs and errors by the end of every sprint. Moreover, some features are
dependent on other features already being implemented, hence, there will be some
bottlenecking due to dependencies so to reduce them and since we also plan to make 
detailed testing and final code optimizing before submitting the project to the client, We
believe the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitious.

Customer
Consider a school, or a university, which has moved education to the online mode due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The institute wants their students not to lag behind with their education.
They wish to develop a software for students, where they conduct their test/assessment
online.This will help students to boost their knowledge and maintain competition among them.

Section 2 - Feasibility Report
1. Overview of the Existing Systems and Technologies
Our system resembles most of Google Forms which is a famous and popular platform. Google
form supports functions like online quizzes and surveys. Our application too supports real time
quizzes, in addition to it our application will be more suited to educational institutes ,where
teachers and students will have separate user systems. Students will have their separate
profile.
2. Scope of the Project
Main actors of this system:-
● School/University and other educational institutes
○ Signup/Login
○ Post test online for students
○ Maintain record of students data
● Students
○ Signup/Login
○ Do the test/assessment in real time
○ Maintain their profile which includes test results
